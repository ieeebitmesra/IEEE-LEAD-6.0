# IEEE-LEAD-6.0

This is a student repository for projects submitted during IEEE LEAD 2024.

## Project structure

Your project should be in a single folder (named with your full name) which needs to be uploaded in the respective domain folder. There should be no `.git` folders in your project, because `IEEE-LEAD-6.0` is itself a git repository and repositories can't be nested.

You can look at the final structure of repository from a repository of previous editions of LEAD. Although this year we have multiple domains, the main motive remains the same.

> NOTE: In the `README.md` file of your project, ensure to include either a link to the hosted website or a short video demo of your website.

## Submitting your project (one-time setup)

Follow these steps only once when you begin:

1. Fork this repository so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.
2. Go to your forked repository. Notice that the end of the URL should resemble `<your_github_username>/IEEE-LEAD-6.0`.
3. Clone your forked repository: click the green **Code** button and copy the HTTPS URL.
4. Open a terminal in the folder where you want to clone the repository and run:

```bash
git clone <paste_your_cloned_URL_here>
```

5. After cloning is done, confirm that a folder named `IEEE-LEAD-6.0` is present in your current working directory.

## Submitting each project

When you're ready to submit a project, follow these steps for each project:

- Copy your project folder (the whole project directory).
- Paste it in the local clone of `IEEE-LEAD-6.0` (created in the steps above), inside the respective domain folder.
- Rename your project folder to your full name.

Open a terminal in the `IEEE-LEAD-6.0` folder and run the following commands in order:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push -u origin main
```

After pushing your project to GitHub, create a Pull Request to the main IEEE LEAD repository. To do that, open your forked repository in a browser — you should see a big green button saying **Compare & pull request**. Click it, review your changes, then click **Create Pull Request**.

That's it — your Pull Request is submitted! 🎉

If you'd like, you can add a short demo link (hosted site) or a video attachment in your project folder and mention it in your project's `README.md`.
